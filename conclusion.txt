4: Answer the questions: Where does your model fit in the fitting graph? and What are the next models you are thinking of and why? By looking at the difference between the actual and predicted y, we can conclude that our model is on the right track. Next model, we can try the XGboost and the DNN to make it even better.

6. Conclusion section: What is the conclusion of your 1st model? What can be done to possibly improve it? Our first model is the linear regression with five features. The features includes:{}. And the simple linear regression model has a MSE 2.19 We can possibly include min-max nomoralization for different features. Since we have 5 features, the distribuntion of the datas may not be representative enough by a simple line. We may try PCA to lower the dimension of the data to find a better fitting curve. Or simply we may examine more powerful model such as XGboost.
